# Week 1 Challenge Website

## Description
This website is a UTA Bootcamp assignment for Week 1.

1. This website refactors all &lt;div&gt; elements into semantic HTML5 elements.
   Semantic HTML5 elements are tags with more concise meanings (ie. &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, etc)

2. This website is refactored to follow a logical structure

3. Image elements shall be marked with alt tags, except non-essential images, which should be tagged with empty alt tags (alt="").
   This is done so screen readers for users with disability only read out essential images, and skip decorative images (ie. icons, etc).

4. Heading attributes shall be in sequential order

5. The title element has a concise, descriptive title.
